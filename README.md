# Introduction to Tensor Flow

This repository is dedicated to the lab section of my e-portfolio called "Introduction to Tensor Flow"

## Setup process 

The lab will be run in Google's Colaboratory, a Jupyter notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud, you don't need to download anything. To run these labs, you must have a Google account. You have two options to open these labs in Colab.

Option 1: On this Github repo, navigate to the lab you want to run and open the appropriate python notebook (*.ipynb). Click the "Run in Colab" link on the top of the lab. That's it!

Option 2: Go to Colab, and then select the "GitHub" tab in the pop-up window. Enter the GitHub link to the Repository, and open the relevant lab.
